# Chapter 13 — Builder Codes as a Protocol Primitive

## §13.0  Framing — what builder codes are, and what they aren't

A **builder code** is a per-frontend identifier that gets attached to a trade. When a user opens an order through a frontend, the frontend includes its builder code in the transaction; the program then credits a configurable fraction of the trade's protocol fee to that builder's on-chain account.

Hyperliquid coined the term in its current sense. It is the protocol-native mechanism that lets a frontend monetize its order flow without having to operate the order book itself. Same family as "router fees" (Uniswap), "white-label routing" (CEXes), "introducing broker" (TradFi) — Solana's version of a long-standing distribution incentive.

Two things builder codes are **not**:

- **Referral codes.** Referral codes reward whoever introduced a new user; they typically pay once per signup or as a long-tail percentage of the referee's fees forever. Builder codes pay per *trade* and don't track who introduced whom — they reward routing, not introductions.
- **Maker/taker rebates.** Maker rebates pay the user (the limit order placer) part of their own fee back. Builder codes pay a *third party* (the frontend) a fraction of the user's fee. The user pays the same gross fee either way; what differs is who receives the split.

This chapter ships three instructions:

1. **`RegisterBuilder`** — each builder creates a per-builder `BuilderProfile` PDA that holds their accumulated fees and their self-declared max share. Registration is required because the program needs an account to credit; no account, no fees.
2. **`PlaceOrderWithBuilder`** — the trading instruction variant that takes a builder profile as a fourth account. Computes the protocol fee, splits the builder's share into the profile's `accumulated_fees`, and runs the same place-order path as `PlaceOrderChecked`.
3. **`ClaimBuilderFees`** — the builder's withdraw call. Zeroes the accumulator and logs the amount. Unlike Chapters 11 and 12 — which we extended with real SPL Token escrow — the chapter deliberately stops short of moving tokens for the fee split. §13.5 explains why builder-fee escrow is a different design problem than position or vault escrow, and lays out what a production implementation would look like.

The chapter's intellectual content is three-part: the atomicity argument in §13.4 (why fee splits happen inside the trade instruction, not in a separate "claim per trade" call), the cap-stacking pattern in §13.2 (how a self-declared cap interacts with the protocol-level cap to bound fee leakage even if a builder is compromised), and the production-escrow design discussion in §13.5 (what makes builder fees a structurally harder escrow problem than the two-party movements of Chapters 11 and 12).

## §13.1  The `BuilderProfile` account

From `crates/state/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Pod, Zeroable)]
pub struct BuilderProfile {
    pub discriminator: [u8; 8],
    pub bump: u8,
    pub _pad0: [u8; 7],
    pub builder: [u8; 32],          // pubkey of the builder
    pub max_fee_share_bps: u64,     // self-cap, clamped at register-time
    pub accumulated_fees: u64,      // claim target
    pub total_volume: u64,          // stat: base size routed through this builder
    pub _reserved: [u8; 32],
}
```

104 bytes. The four meaningful fields:

**`builder`** is the pubkey of the frontend / aggregator. Used as the only seed in the PDA derivation: `[BUILDER_PROFILE_SEED, builder.key]`. This means every Solana pubkey has at most one builder profile, derivable by anyone who knows the pubkey. The profile is owned by openhl-core (so only this program can mutate `accumulated_fees`), but anyone can *read* the public-facing fields (`builder`, `total_volume`) to verify a builder's claimed routing volume.

**`max_fee_share_bps`** is the builder's self-declared cap on what fraction of the protocol fee they will take. A builder that registers with `max_fee_share_bps = 2000` is publicly committing to take at most 20% of the protocol fee on any order routed through them. This is a credibility signal — a builder advertising "20% to us, 80% to protocol" vs. one advertising "50/50" tells users something about how the frontend monetizes. Lower self-cap → more user-friendly fee split → potentially more flow.

**`accumulated_fees`** is the running total of fees credited to the builder, awaiting claim. Incremented by every `PlaceOrderWithBuilder` that routes through this profile. Reset to zero by `ClaimBuilderFees`. The builder accumulates inside the program account and withdraws in batches — much cheaper than claiming once per trade.

**`total_volume`** is observability — base size routed through the builder. Used by builders to prove their flow to potential partners (or by users to vet a builder's track record). Not used by the program for any logic.

Two design constraints worth noting:

- **One profile per builder.** The PDA derivation makes the (builder pubkey) → (profile pubkey) mapping bijective. A builder cannot have two profiles with different fee splits per market; if they want to A/B test fee splits they use two different builder wallets.
- **Fee accumulation in quote units.** `accumulated_fees` is denominated in whatever quote currency the protocol fee is taken in. With multiple quote currencies (USDC and USDT, say) the design would need per-(builder, mint) profiles, not just per-builder. We deliberately keep it single-quote here since the rest of the program is also single-quote.

> **Exercise §13.1.** A frontend registers with `max_fee_share_bps = 3000`. Three trades route through them: notional 1000, 2500, 700. With `PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS = 10` (0.1%), what is the total `accumulated_fees` after all three trades?

---

## §13.2  Two caps, stacked

Builder codes need *two* fee-share caps, not one, because two parties have different incentives:

**Protocol cap (`PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS = 5000`)** — the maximum fraction of any protocol fee that *any* builder may keep. Hard-coded into the program. With our value of 5000 bps, the protocol guarantees that at least 50% of every protocol fee stays with the protocol regardless of builder configuration.

**Builder self-cap (`BuilderProfile.max_fee_share_bps`)** — the maximum fraction this *particular* builder will keep. Self-declared at registration; user-visible.

The effective share on any trade is `min(builder.max_fee_share_bps, PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS)`. From `programs/openhl-core/src/lib.rs:2742–2748`:

```rust
share_bps = profile.max_fee_share_bps;
if share_bps > PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS {
    // Defensive: registered profile shouldn't exceed cap, but the
    // cap could have been lowered since the builder registered.
    share_bps = PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS;
}
```

The protocol cap clamps at register-time (the user can't request more than the cap), but it also re-clamps at trade-time — because the cap could conceivably be lowered between registration and trade. (Our chapter ships a constant; a real program might make `PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS` a governance-tunable value living on a config account, which is exactly where the defensive re-clamp matters.)

The two-cap structure is the core safety property. Three failure modes it handles:

1. **Malicious builder.** A builder who somehow declares `max_fee_share_bps = 10000` (100% of fee) at registration is clamped to `PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS` immediately. The protocol always keeps its floor.
2. **User mistake.** A user who routes through an unfamiliar builder still knows the *maximum* possible fee leak before the trade — they can read both caps from on-chain state. No surprise fees.
3. **Compromised builder.** If a builder's wallet is compromised and the attacker tries to inflate their share, they can't go above the registered cap (immutable after register) without re-registering — which would create a new PDA at a different address, breaking the existing flow.

Production builder programs often add a *third* cap — a per-market or per-asset cap that lets the protocol charge different fee splits in different markets. Our chapter omits this for clarity; the pattern extends naturally.

> **Exercise §13.2.** A builder is registered with `max_fee_share_bps = 8000`. Run through the cap stacking: what's their effective share with our `PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS = 5000`? What if a governance vote drops the protocol cap to 3000 *after* the builder registered — what happens on the next trade through their profile?

## §13.3  Walking `PlaceOrderWithBuilder`

`process_place_order_with_builder` at `programs/openhl-core/src/lib.rs:2680–2817`. The handler is a strict superset of `PlaceOrderChecked` — same checks, same place logic — with one fee-split block inserted between the validation and the order write.

**Validation + sanity band** (lines 2693–2724): identical to `PlaceOrderChecked` except for the additional `builder_profile_ai` slot in `accounts`. The oracle staleness check, the price sanity band against the oracle mark — all carried over verbatim.

**Fee computation + builder credit** (lines 2726–2775):

```rust
let notional_val = (price as u128) * (size as u128);
let protocol_fee = (notional_val * (PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS as u128) / 10_000) as u64;

// ... read builder profile, compute share_bps clamped to caps ...

let builder_share = ((protocol_fee as u128) * (share_bps as u128) / 10_000) as u64;
profile.accumulated_fees = profile.accumulated_fees.checked_add(builder_share)?;
new_volume = profile.total_volume.checked_add(size)?;
profile.total_volume = new_volume;
```

Three numbers fall out:

- `notional_val = price × size` — the trade's gross value in quote-unit-scaled form.
- `protocol_fee = notional × 10 / 10_000` — 0.1% of notional, in quote units.
- `builder_share = protocol_fee × share_bps / 10_000` — fraction of the protocol fee, in quote units.

`builder_share` is added to `profile.accumulated_fees` with `checked_add` (overflow refuses the trade rather than silently capping — the builder can claim periodically to keep the running total under u64::MAX). `total_volume` advances by the trade size for observability.

The remaining `protocol_fee - builder_share` is retained by the protocol. In our scope-deferred version it stays implicit (we don't track it anywhere); in production it would be transferred to a protocol fee vault account via SPL Token CPI. The chapter's pedagogical point lands either way: the split happens atomically with the trade.

**Order placement** (lines 2780–2811): identical to `PlaceOrderChecked` from §9.4. Linear-scan for an empty slot, write the order, increment counters. The CU cost of `PlaceOrderWithBuilder` is `PlaceOrderChecked + ~600 CU` for the fee math and the builder profile borrow.

> **Exercise §13.3.** What happens if `PlaceOrderWithBuilder` is called with `price × size` so large that `notional × PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS` overflows `u128`? Trace the failure path. Why is `u128` the right precision for this calculation rather than `u64`?

---

## §13.4  The atomicity argument

`PlaceOrderWithBuilder` does the fee split *inside the same instruction* as the order placement. There is no "after each trade, builder calls a separate `RecordFee(trade_id, amount)` instruction" pattern. The atomicity is load-bearing for three reasons:

**1. Settlement honesty.** If the fee split happened in a separate transaction, the user could pay the trade fee at slot N and the builder could fail to receive their share at slot N+1 (their account was closed, the cap changed, etc.). Atomicity means: either the trade commits with the split applied, or neither happens. No "I paid the fee but the builder didn't get credit" failure mode.

**2. CU efficiency.** A separate "record fee" instruction would cost another transaction's worth of fees, network round-trip, and CU overhead — for every single trade. With thousands of trades per day per builder, that adds up to material cost. Inline accumulation pays once per trade, claim pays once per N trades, total cost is amortized.

**3. Scheduling.** A separate fee-recording instruction would require the builder profile to be a writable account in *every* trade transaction even when split == 0. Sealevel would then serialize all trades on the same builder's profile (Chapter 5's antipattern). With the split inside the trade, *only trades routed through that builder* touch the profile — so two builders' flows can be processed in parallel even if both involve the same market.

The split between **accrual** (atomic with trade, inside `PlaceOrderWithBuilder`) and **claim** (batch, separate `ClaimBuilderFees` call) is also load-bearing. Claim is the expensive operation: it needs to move actual tokens (in production), which means an SPL Token CPI, which means signer setup and account validation. Doing that per-trade would be wasteful. By accumulating in the profile and letting builders claim periodically (hourly, daily, whatever), the per-trade cost stays minimal.

This accrue-batch-claim pattern is identical to ERC-20 dividend distributions in Ethereum-land — same problem, same solution, different runtime.

> **Exercise §13.4.** Sketch the alternative design where every trade emits a separate `RecordFee` instruction that the builder must process. Count the writes against the BuilderProfile account per second under load (say, 10 trades/sec routed through one builder). Compare to our design. Which one Sealevel-serializes more aggressively?

---

## §13.5  `RegisterBuilder` and `ClaimBuilderFees`

Both are short. `RegisterBuilder` (lines 2604–2670) is the standard PDA-creation pattern from Chapter 3, with one twist: the requested `max_fee_share_bps` is clamped at registration time:

```rust
if max_share > PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS {
    msg!(
        "register_builder: requested {} bps clamped to protocol cap {} bps",
        max_share,
        PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS
    );
    max_share = PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS;
}
```

The clamp is silent — the registration succeeds, just with a reduced share. Logging the clamp lets builders verify their effective cap from program logs.

`ClaimBuilderFees` (lines 2819–2860) is even simpler:

```rust
if profile.builder != *builder_ai.key.as_ref() {
    return Err(ProgramError::IllegalOwner);
}

let claimed = profile.accumulated_fees;
profile.accumulated_fees = 0;

msg!(
    "claim_builder_fees: builder {} claimed {} units ...",
    builder_ai.key,
    claimed
);
```

Authorization (only the builder can claim their own fees), zero the accumulator, log. In production this is where an SPL Token Transfer CPI would PDA-sign a move of `claimed` quote tokens from a protocol fee-vault token account into the builder's token account.

A real production claim also typically supports partial withdrawals (`claim --amount N` rather than always-everything), accumulator timeouts (fees idle for >N days are forfeited to the protocol), and per-token claims when the protocol supports multiple quote currencies. None of these change the fundamental shape; they're policy decisions on top.

> **Exercise §13.5.** Modify `process_claim_builder_fees` to accept a `partial_amount: Option<u64>` in the payload. If `Some(n)`, claim `min(n, accumulated_fees)`; if `None`, claim all. Why is the partial-withdraw pattern useful for builders even though the total they can withdraw is the same?

### Production-escrow design notes (why this one is left as homework)

Chapters 11 and 12 added real SPL Token escrow to position collateral and vault deposits. This chapter does not. The reason is that builder-fee escrow is a *structurally different* escrow problem than the two-party token movements those chapters needed — and a single concrete implementation would mislead more than teach. Four design choices have to be made before any plumbing gets written.

**1. Two parties vs three.** Position collateral and vault deposits are two-party movements: user ↔ vault, signed by one side, with the entire economic decision (how much, signed by whom) encoded in the instruction. Builder fees are a *three-party split*: the user pays a single protocol fee, of which one fraction goes to the protocol and another to the builder. Splitting one user payment across two recipients atomically — and crediting the right fraction to each — needs a different shape than `spl_token_transfer_user_signed` and `spl_token_transfer_vault_signed` provide. The natural implementation is a *fee-vault* token account (one per quote mint) owned by a PDA at e.g. `[b"fee_vault", quote_mint]`. Every `PlaceOrderWithBuilder` would (a) Transfer the *full* `protocol_fee` from the user's token account into the fee vault, then (b) credit `builder_share` to the builder's accumulator. The `(protocol_fee - builder_share)` remainder stays in the fee vault as the protocol's take.

**2. The `PlaceOrderChecked` asymmetry.** Adding fee escrow only to `PlaceOrderWithBuilder` creates a perverse incentive: the no-builder path (`PlaceOrderChecked`) doesn't charge any token-denominated fee, so trades through a builder would cost the user more in real terms than identical trades without one. The natural fix is to make *all* place-order variants escrow the protocol fee — which is a bigger surgery on the trade path than the chapter can land without bloating §13.3 beyond utility. Production deployments resolve this by treating the protocol fee as universal across both variants from day one.

**3. Multi-quote support.** With one quote currency (our case) the fee vault is a single account. With multiple quote currencies the design needs per-(quote_mint) fee vaults *and* per-(builder, quote_mint) accumulators — meaning `BuilderProfile` either grows a map field (not Pod-friendly) or splits into many one-per-quote profile PDAs. §13.1 mentioned the single-quote constraint as deliberate; the production escrow design is where it actually starts costing accounts.

**4. Claim-side authority.** Once the fee vault exists, `ClaimBuilderFees` becomes a PDA-signed Transfer from `fee_vault` to `builder_token`, signed by the fee-vault authority PDA. Structurally identical to §12.4's `VaultWithdraw` — same `invoke_signed` pattern, same `InvalidSeeds` protection, different seeds. This is the only piece that's a "mechanical extension" of work the chapter already did.

The mechanism the chapter actually teaches — accrual atomic with trade, claim as a separate batch operation, two-cap safety — survives all four design choices unchanged. Only the SPL Token plumbing differs across them.

> **Exercise §13.5b (design).** Sketch the account layout for a production `ClaimBuilderFees`: which accounts must be passed (in order), which are signers, which are PDAs, and which seeds derive them. You don't need to write code — just the `accounts: vec![...]` declaration as it would appear in `scripts/builder/src/main.rs`. Compare with §12.4's `VaultWithdraw` declaration: what's structurally identical, what's structurally different, and which difference traces back to which of the four design choices above?

## §13.6  Recap + verify yourself

### Recap diagram

```
Builder lifecycle:

  1) Builder registers
     RegisterBuilder(max_fee_share_bps=2000)
     ──► BuilderProfile{ builder, max_share=2000, fees=0, vol=0 }


  2) User trades through builder
     PlaceOrderWithBuilder(side, price, size)
     accounts: [user(S), book(W), oracle(R), builder_profile(W)]

       notional       = price × size
       protocol_fee   = notional × 10 / 10000    (PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS)
       share_bps      = min(profile.max, 5000)    (PROTOCOL cap)
       builder_share  = protocol_fee × share_bps / 10000

     atomic:
       order placed in book                       ─┐
       profile.accumulated_fees += builder_share   ├─ same tx, same slot
       profile.total_volume     += size            ─┘


  3) Builder claims periodically
     ClaimBuilderFees(empty)
     ──► profile.accumulated_fees = 0
     ──► (production: SPL Token CPI moves the claimed amount)


Two-cap safety:

  effective_share = min( builder.max_fee_share_bps
                       , PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS
                       )

  ↑ builder commits to maximum self-cap (user-visible)
  ↑ protocol commits to maximum cap-of-caps (hard-coded / governance)

  Floor on protocol take = (10000 - 5000) × PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS / 10000
                         = 5 bps of notional, always retained
```

### Three things to verify yourself

1. **The cap stacks correctly.** Register a builder with `--max-share-bps 9999`. The handler should log the clamp, and the dump should show `max_fee_share_bps = 5000` (our `PROTOCOL_BUILDER_SHARE_CAP_BPS`). Now route a trade through them — the builder's share should be exactly 50% of the protocol fee.
2. **Atomicity holds under failure.** Use a simulated failure: try `PlaceOrderWithBuilder` with a stale oracle (so the order placement will fail). The simulation should fail with `oracle stale` *and* the builder profile's `accumulated_fees` should be unchanged after the failed sim (because the entire transaction reverts). The split doesn't happen unless the trade does.
3. **Volume accrues per trade.** Place 5 orders through the same builder with sizes 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. The `total_volume` should be exactly 150 (10+20+30+40+50). If `accumulated_fees` doesn't add up to `(notional_total × PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS × share_bps / 10000 / 10000)`, there's an off-by-one in the math — chase it down.

## Hook into Chapter 14

You now have a perp DEX program that handles every primitive a production deployment needs: accounts, programs, PDAs, CPI, compute, parallelism, vaults, an order book, a matcher, an oracle reader, funding, positions, liquidations, pooled trading vaults, and builder codes. What you do *not* have is the off-chain plumbing that keeps it running.

Chapter 14 — Cranks, Keepers, and Off-Chain Glue — closes Phase B and the track. We will walk through every keeper this program implicitly requires: the funding-rate keeper (Chapter 10's hook), the liquidator bots (Chapter 11's permissionless `Liquidate`), the vault NAV reporter (Chapter 12's `UpdateNAV` cadence), the builder claim cron (Chapter 13's accumulator), the oracle publisher (Chapter 9's `SetOraclePrice` if we ran it ourselves rather than using Pyth), the matching-engine cranker (if we'd built async matching), and the off-chain indexer that feeds frontends. The chapter has zero new on-chain code — its content is design patterns for off-chain processes, fee economics, redundancy and failover, and the architectural reality that "Solana DEX" is half on-chain program and half coordinated off-chain infrastructure.
