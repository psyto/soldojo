# Chapter 11 — Position Lifecycle and Liquidation Engine

> Status: draft (v0.1).
> Companion code: `crates/state/src/lib.rs` (`Position`), `programs/openhl-core/src/lib.rs` (helpers + `process_open_position` 1881–1993, `process_close_position` 1995–2061, `process_liquidate` 2063–2152), `scripts/position/src/main.rs`.

## §11.0  Framing — and the missing CPI

This is the convergence chapter. Every other Phase A and Phase B primitive — oracle, funding, vault, matcher, parallelism — exists so this chapter can be written. A perp DEX without `OpenPosition` / `ClosePosition` / `Liquidate` is a collection of pieces; a perp DEX with them is a perp DEX.

The chapter ships three instructions:

1. **`OpenPosition`** — creates a per-(user, market) Position PDA, reads the oracle for the entry price, snapshots the cumulative funding index for later settlement, and validates that the user has posted enough collateral to meet the initial margin requirement.
2. **`ClosePosition`** — the owner's exit. Settles funding via the snapshot pattern from Chapter 10, computes realized PnL = `size × (mark - entry)`, applies it to the collateral, zeros the position.
3. **`Liquidate`** — anyone's exit on someone else's underwater position. Computes equity, compares to maintenance margin, and if the position has fallen below, force-closes at the current mark and pays a penalty (out of remaining collateral) to the liquidator.

One scope honesty note up front: **collateral here is tracked, not escrowed.** Real production would integrate Chapter 6's vault — `OpenPosition` would CPI an SPL Token Transfer from the user's quote token account into the market vault, and the converse on close/liquidate. The math in this chapter is exactly the math you'd run regardless of where the tokens live; what's missing is the SPL Token CPI plumbing. Adding it is mechanical (the patterns from Chapter 6's `Deposit` carry over directly) but doubles the AccountMeta count of every handler and obscures the lifecycle/math focus.

In production you'd also split closed collateral between the liquidator and an **insurance fund** account — the fund covers shortfalls when a position closes underwater and there isn't enough collateral to satisfy the counterparty. We discuss the insurance fund's role in §11.6 but don't implement it; that's a small follow-up chapter on its own.

## §11.1  The `Position` account

One PDA per (user, market) pair. 144 bytes. From `crates/state/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Pod, Zeroable)]
pub struct Position {
    pub discriminator: [u8; 8],
    pub bump: u8,
    pub _pad0: [u8; 7],
    pub user: [u8; 32],
    pub market: [u8; 32],
    pub size: i64,                    // base units; signed: long > 0, short < 0
    pub entry_price: u64,             // quote per base, stamped at open
    pub collateral: u64,              // quote units posted as margin
    pub funding_snapshot_index: i64,  // FundingState.cumulative at last touch
    pub _reserved: [u8; 32],
}
```

Six load-bearing fields, plus discriminator + bump + padding.

**`size: i64`** is signed. A long position has positive size; a short has negative. `size == 0` is the "position closed" sentinel — like the empty-slot convention in Chapter 7. After a close or liquidate, the account stays around with `size = 0`, and can be reopened by issuing a fresh `OpenPosition` (which will derive the same PDA and write over the dormant state). We chose not to literally close the account (refunding rent) because the per-(user, market) PDA derivation guarantees a position-or-nothing relationship, and keeping the slot around saves a re-create CPI on reopen.

**`entry_price: u64`** is the mark price stamped from the oracle at `OpenPosition` time. It's the reference point for price PnL: `(mark - entry) × size`. We do not maintain a running entry-price for partial closes; the chapter's `ClosePosition` is all-or-nothing. Partial closes would require resetting `entry_price` to a size-weighted blend on each partial — a useful extension but not in scope.

**`collateral: u64`** is the quote-currency margin amount. Strictly positive while the position is open; can be reduced to zero by underwater close or liquidation. Cannot go negative — losses beyond collateral are socialized to the insurance fund (or, in our scope-deferred version, just lost).

**`funding_snapshot_index: i64`** is the cumulative funding index at the last touch (open, close, liquidate). The per-position settle pattern from Chapter 10 makes this the only field needed for funding accounting — the delta between `funding_now` and `funding_snapshot_index` times `size` is the funding PnL accrued since the snapshot.

The PDA derivation uses both `user` and `market` as seeds: `[b"position", user.key, market.key]`. So every (user, market) pair has exactly one position address that everyone can compute without storing a mapping anywhere. The pubkey is bound to the asset pair and the trader by the seed scheme alone.

> **Exercise §11.1.** Why does the position store both `user` and `market` *inside* the account, despite both being seeds of the PDA derivation? (Hint: think about what a third party reading the account knows vs. what they have to derive.)

## §11.2  Equity, notional, and the margin formulas

Before walking the handlers, fix the formulas. From `programs/openhl-core/src/lib.rs:1814–1834`:

```rust
fn compute_equity(position: &Position, mark: u64, funding_index_now: i64) -> i128 {
    let size = position.size as i128;
    let entry = position.entry_price as i128;
    let mark_i = mark as i128;
    let collateral = position.collateral as i128;

    let price_pnl = size * (mark_i - entry);

    let funding_delta = (funding_index_now as i128) - (position.funding_snapshot_index as i128);
    let funding_pnl = funding_delta * size / 1_000_000_000_i128;

    collateral + price_pnl + funding_pnl
}

fn notional(size: i64, mark: u64) -> u128 {
    let abs_size = (size.unsigned_abs()) as u128;
    abs_size * (mark as u128)
}
```

Three quantities the chapter cares about.

**Notional** = `|size| × mark`. The dollar (quote-currency) value of the position at current price. A long of 5 base units at mark 100 has notional 500 quote units. Both long and short have positive notional — direction matters for PnL, not for notional.

**Price PnL** = `size × (mark - entry)`. Signed. Long positions profit when mark rises (positive size × positive delta = positive PnL); short positions profit when mark falls (negative size × negative delta = positive PnL). The arithmetic works without special-casing direction because `size` carries the sign.

**Funding PnL** = `(index_now - index_snapshot) × size / 1e9`. Same shape as price PnL but with the funding index playing the role of price. The `/1e9` un-scales the 1e9 scaling Chapter 10's `FundingState` uses for its index. For a long with positive size, a rising funding index (longs paying shorts) means positive `funding_delta × size`, which becomes negative funding PnL after the formula's signs work out — exactly the right semantics.

**Equity** = `collateral + price_pnl + funding_pnl`. The total quote-currency value the position commands right now. Equity can go negative for severely underwater positions; the program clamps to zero on close/liquidate (the loss is socialized rather than passed to a counterparty).

**Maintenance margin** = `notional × MAINT_MARGIN_BPS / 10000`. The minimum equity required to keep the position open. With `MAINT_MARGIN_BPS = 500` (5%), a 500-notional position needs equity ≥ 25 quote to avoid liquidation.

**Initial margin** = `notional × INITIAL_MARGIN_BPS / 10000`. The minimum collateral required at open. With `INITIAL_MARGIN_BPS = 1000` (10%), the same 500-notional position needs ≥ 50 quote of collateral to open.

The gap between IM (10%) and MM (5%) is the **maintenance buffer** — how far the position can move against you before you're liquidated. A position opened at IM and immediately moving 50% of its notional against you would have equity zero (collateral wiped out) before liquidation triggers; a position opened at IM with a 5% adverse move would still be healthy. The narrower the IM↔MM gap, the more capital-efficient but the easier to liquidate.

> **Exercise §11.2.** A long position is opened with size = 10 base units, entry = 100, collateral = 200 (10% IM). Compute equity at marks 90, 95, 100, 105, 110. At which marks is the position liquidatable? (Ignore funding for now.)

---

## §11.3  Walking `OpenPosition`

`process_open_position` at `programs/openhl-core/src/lib.rs:1881–1993`. The handler decomposes into five parts.

**Validation** (lines 1894–1916): payload size, non-zero size and collateral, user is signer, market is owned by us, system program is the System program. PDA derivation:

```rust
let (expected, bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[POSITION_SEED, user_ai.key.as_ref(), market_ai.key.as_ref()],
    program_id,
);
if position_ai.key != &expected {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidSeeds);
}
```

**Read external inputs** (lines 1922–1923):

```rust
let mark = read_fresh_oracle(oracle_ai, program_id)?;
let funding_snapshot = read_funding_index(funding_ai, program_id)?;
```

`read_fresh_oracle` (lines 1838–1858) factors the Chapter 9 staleness gauntlet into a helper — same checks (owner + discriminator + price>0 + age vs Clock), reused across all three position handlers. `read_funding_index` (lines 1860–1869) is the simpler read used to snapshot the funding index.

**Initial margin check** (lines 1932–1942):

```rust
let notional_val = notional(size, mark);
let im_required = notional_val * (INITIAL_MARGIN_BPS as u128) / 10_000;
if (collateral as u128) < im_required {
    msg!(
        "open_position: collateral {} < initial margin {} ...",
        collateral, im_required, ...
    );
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}
```

The collateral must cover at least 10% of notional. If you ask for a position of 10 at price 100 (notional = 1000) with collateral 50, the check rejects: 50 < 100 (IM). With collateral 100, accepted exactly at IM. With collateral 200, accepted with 100 of buffer above IM.

**Allocate the PDA** (lines 1946–1960): standard `invoke_signed` to `System::create_account`, signing with the position PDA's seeds. Same pattern as `CreateMarket`, `CreateVault`, etc. — Chapter 3 introduced it, every subsequent chapter has reused it.

**Write the layout** (lines 1962–1978):

```rust
position.size = size;
position.entry_price = mark;
position.collateral = collateral;
position.funding_snapshot_index = funding_snapshot;
```

Four data writes. `entry_price = mark` stamps the oracle's price as the position's reference. `funding_snapshot_index = funding_snapshot` captures the funding index at this moment — every future close/liquidate computes funding PnL as the delta from this snapshot.

> **Exercise §11.3.** What happens if you try to `OpenPosition` against a stale oracle (more than 25 slots since the last `SetOraclePrice`)? Trace the failure path through `read_fresh_oracle`. Then run `funding --update --rate 0` and `oracle --set --price ...` and re-try the open.

---

## §11.4  Walking `ClosePosition`

`process_close_position` at lines 1995–2061. Simpler than open — no PDA creation, just settle and zero.

**Validation + owner check** (lines 2007–2024):

```rust
if position.user != *user_ai.key.as_ref() {
    msg!("close_position: caller is not the position owner");
    return Err(ProgramError::IllegalOwner);
}
```

Only the position's owner may close it voluntarily. Liquidate (§11.5) is the route for anyone else. The user check uses the `user` field stored in the position rather than the PDA derivation — same information, easier to read.

**Read external inputs + compute equity** (lines 2026–2040):

```rust
let mark = read_fresh_oracle(oracle_ai, program_id)?;
let funding_now = read_funding_index(funding_ai, program_id)?;
// ...
let equity = compute_equity(position, mark, funding_now);
```

The same oracle + funding read pattern from open. Equity is the only computation that matters at close — it tells us what the position is worth right now in quote-currency terms.

**Realize PnL** (lines 2046–2058):

```rust
let new_collateral = if equity < 0 { 0 } else { equity as u64 };
position.collateral = new_collateral;
position.size = 0;
position.entry_price = 0;
position.funding_snapshot_index = funding_now;
```

Four writes:

1. **Collateral becomes equity** (or zero if underwater). A profitable close grows the collateral; a losing close shrinks it; an underwater close wipes it to zero. In production this collateral would then move out of the vault back to the user via SPL Token CPI; here it just sits in the position account, ready to be returned by a follow-up "withdraw" instruction not implemented yet.
2. **Size = 0** marks the position as closed. The PDA stays allocated; reopening derives the same PDA and writes over the dormant state.
3. **Entry price = 0** is housekeeping — keeps the dormant state recognizable (a zeroed `entry_price` is impossible for an open position).
4. **Funding snapshot = current** so a subsequent reopen starts from a fresh snapshot rather than re-applying the old delta.

**Underwater closes lose collateral, don't pass losses on.** A position that closes with equity = -50 (loss exceeds collateral) wipes the collateral to 0 and stops there. The counterparty (whoever was on the other side of the original trade — implicitly, the matcher / book) doesn't get notified or made whole. This is the place where a real perp DEX would tap an insurance fund: "the position closed with a 50-unit shortfall; insurance fund covers it, the other side gets paid in full." See §11.6.

> **Exercise §11.4.** Open a position at entry = 100, size = 5, collateral = 100. Move the oracle to mark = 80. Close. The expected equity is `100 + 5 × (80 - 100) = 0`. Verify the position post-state has `collateral = 0`.

---

## §11.5  Walking `Liquidate`

`process_liquidate` at lines 2063–2152. The crucial difference from close: **anyone can call it**.

**Validation** (lines 2076–2091): the *liquidator* must be a signer, but the program does *not* check that the liquidator matches the position's user. Anyone can call liquidate on anyone's position.

```rust
let liquidator_ai = accounts.first().ok_or(...)?;
// ...
if !liquidator_ai.is_signer { return Err(...); }
```

This permissionless property is the heart of the liquidation engine. The system pays a small bounty (the liquidation penalty) to whoever first notices an underwater position and submits the liquidation tx. Without this, liquidations would depend on the protocol team running a centralized liquidator bot — which works but introduces uptime risk.

**Health check** (lines 2098–2111):

```rust
let equity = compute_equity(position, mark, funding_now);
let notional_val = notional(position.size, mark);
let maint_required = (notional_val * (MAINT_MARGIN_BPS as u128) / 10_000) as i128;

if equity >= maint_required {
    msg!(
        "liquidate: position is healthy (equity {} >= maint {}), not liquidatable",
        equity, maint_required
    );
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}
```

If `equity >= maintenance_margin`, the position is fine and the call is rejected. The liquidator just paid tx fees for nothing — a small disincentive to spam-call liquidate against healthy positions. (Production protocols sometimes refund tx fees when this happens, or simply expect liquidators to do their own off-chain health check before submitting.)

**Apply penalty and force-close** (lines 2117–2147):

```rust
let liquidation_penalty = ((notional_val * (LIQUIDATION_PENALTY_BPS as u128) / 10_000)
    .min(i64::MAX as u128)) as i128;

let mut realized = if equity < 0 { 0 } else { equity };
realized = (realized - liquidation_penalty).max(0);
let new_collateral = realized as u64;

position.collateral = new_collateral;
position.size = 0;
position.entry_price = 0;
position.funding_snapshot_index = funding_now;
```

The penalty is taken out of what's left of the position's equity. `LIQUIDATION_PENALTY_BPS = 100` = 1% of notional. The remaining collateral (after penalty) stays in the position account; in production the penalty amount would be transferred from the vault to the liquidator's token account via SPL Token CPI.

The penalty serves two purposes:

1. **Liquidator incentive.** Running a liquidator bot has costs (RPC bandwidth, gas, monitoring infra). The penalty is the bounty that makes the work economically viable.
2. **User disincentive.** Approaching the liquidation threshold becomes costly even if you'd ultimately survive (e.g., the price reverses immediately after liquidation). Users are pushed to maintain higher buffers above MM than the IM↔MM gap suggests.

The Liquidate handler does NOT verify *why* the position is underwater. It could be price movement (mark moved against you), funding accumulation (rate compounded over time), or both. The equity calculation includes both contributions, and the maintenance check is on equity vs notional regardless of the cause. This is correct: liquidation triggers on insolvency, not on root cause.

> **Exercise §11.5.** Build the textbook "death spiral" scenario:
>   1. Open a long at size = 10, entry = 100, collateral = 100 (right at IM).
>   2. Move the oracle mark to 95 (price drop). Check `equity` and `maint_required` — is the position liquidatable? The drop costs 10 × (95 − 100) = -50, so equity = 50, maint = 10×95×0.05 = 47.5. Still healthy.
>   3. Move to 94. Equity = 40, maint = 47. *Now* liquidatable.
>   4. Submit Liquidate from a *different* keypair. Confirm the position closes and the penalty is applied.

---

## §11.6  The missing pieces — insurance fund and SPL Token plumbing

Two things this chapter explicitly does not implement, with their production roles called out.

**Insurance fund.** A separate `InsuranceFund` account per market holds a pool of quote-currency that covers underwater-close shortfalls. The pattern:

```text
when ClosePosition / Liquidate computes equity < 0:
    shortfall = -equity
    if insurance_fund.balance >= shortfall:
        insurance_fund.balance -= shortfall
        # counterparty made whole, life continues
    else:
        # auto-deleverage or socialized loss — bigger architectural question
```

The insurance fund is funded by a fraction of liquidation penalties (e.g., 50% to liquidator, 50% to insurance fund), exchange fees, and sometimes by exchange equity at launch. Without an insurance fund, every losing position with insufficient collateral imposes a hidden loss on whoever was on the other side — usually the LP pool or the rest of the book.

**SPL Token escrow.** Every operation that mentions "collateral" in this chapter is currently bookkeeping-only. Real production:

- `OpenPosition` CPIs SPL Token Transfer from user's quote token account into the market vault for the `collateral` amount.
- `ClosePosition` CPIs the other direction, returning `new_collateral` to the user.
- `Liquidate` CPIs to the liquidator for the penalty and to the user (or the insurance fund) for the remainder.

Adding this is mechanical: Chapter 6's `Deposit` pattern carries over verbatim. The reason it's not here is that doing so triples the AccountMeta count on every handler (need user_token_account, vault_token_account, token_program for each) and dilutes the lifecycle/math focus this chapter is built around. The deferred chapter (call it Ch.11b) would add the vault CPIs without touching the math at all.

Math:
  notional       = |size| × mark
  initial_margin = notional × INITIAL_MARGIN_BPS / 10000   (10%)
  maint_margin   = notional × MAINT_MARGIN_BPS / 10000     (5%)
  price_pnl      = size × (mark − entry_price)

```

### Three things to verify yourself

1. **The IM↔MM gap is the buffer.** Open a position right at IM (collateral = 10% of notional). Without any oracle move, check via the dump output that the position is healthy (equity ≈ collateral, well above MM). Move the oracle to where the IM gap is consumed (5% adverse). Now equity ≈ MM — still not liquidatable. One more bp of adverse move and `Liquidate` succeeds.
2. **Funding accrual can flip the answer.** Open a position with collateral right at MM. Don't touch the oracle. Let funding accumulate against you via `funding --update --rate 100`, wait a minute, `funding --update --rate 100`. Check the position's computed equity in the dump — funding PnL has dragged it below MM even though the price hasn't moved. `Liquidate` will succeed.
3. **Closing returns collateral; liquidating doesn't.** Open at IM, close immediately (no price move, no funding). `position.collateral` ≈ original. Open at IM again, let it fall to MM, get liquidated by a separate keypair. `position.collateral` after liquidate = equity − penalty ≈ much less. The penalty is the daylight between "exit cleanly" and "let yourself get liquidated."

## Hook into Chapter 12

You now have a perp DEX whose positions can be opened, closed, and force-liquidated. The unit of throughput is now bigger: a single `OpenPosition` involves 6 accounts, a `Liquidate` involves 4, and the supporting reads (oracle + funding) add a few more. The accounts touched form a write-set graph — and how that graph is laid out determines what Sealevel can run in parallel and what serializes.

Chapter 12 builds the **native vault program** — the dedicated wrapper account that aggregates user collateral into a fund that's traded as a whole. Vault depositors share PnL; the vault manager places trades on their behalf using the Phase B primitives we've built. The vault accounts form a different write-set graph than per-position trading: every deposit touches the vault aggregate, every trade touches positions owned by the vault. We'll see how the singleton-write-shared antipattern from Chapter 5 reasserts itself (the vault total *is* a singleton), and the design moves the architecture has to make to keep throughput sane.
